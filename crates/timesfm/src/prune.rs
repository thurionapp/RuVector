//! Predictive pruning for evolutionary / optimization runs (ADR-191 §2).
//!
//! The capability: **kill doomed runs at iteration 50 instead of 1000.** Given
//! the first `K` metric values of a long optimization (e.g. a Darwin genome's
//! exploitability or loss curve, where *lower is better*), use TimesFM to
//! forecast the tail out to a target horizon, estimate the plateau the run is
//! heading toward, and decide `PRUNE` vs `CONTINUE` against a viability
//! threshold.
//!
//! ## Decoupling
//!
//! This module deliberately operates on a **generic numeric curve**
//! (`&[f32]`), not on any poker-darwin / agent-harness-generator type. That
//! keeps `timesfm` free of a cross-repo dependency: the caller is responsible
//! for extracting a monotone (or near-monotone) scalar metric per iteration and
//! handing it in as a `Vec<f32>`. See [`forecast_plateau`] /
//! [`decide_prune`] for the call surface and the doc-comment on
//! [`decide_prune`] for how poker-darwin would wire it in.
//!
//! ## Why TimesFM and not a curve fit
//!
//! A parametric fit (e.g. `a - b·exp(-c·t)`) needs you to *assume* the curve
//! family. TimesFM is a zero-shot foundation forecaster: it reads the shape of
//! the first `K` points and extrapolates without a hand-picked functional form,
//! which is exactly what you want when different genomes converge with
//! different dynamics.
//!
//! ## Honest calibration note (measured 2026-06-24, f32 CPU)
//!
//! On *short, synthetic, sharply-decayed* monotone curves, TimesFM tends to
//! forecast a mild **mean-reversion upward** rather than holding the decayed
//! floor — so the absolute `forecast_plateau` it returns is biased *high* by a
//! constant-ish offset on such inputs (e.g. a curve truly heading to 0.01 may
//! forecast a tail near ~0.3–0.6 from 128 points). What stays robust is the
//! **relative ordering**: a curve heading to a worse floor reliably forecasts a
//! higher plateau than one heading to a better floor (verified across
//! K ∈ {96..256}). The decision logic here is therefore built on two robust
//! signals — (1) doomed runs forecast a plateau *far above* the threshold, and
//! (2) genuinely-good runs trip the *already-viable guard* (best-so-far has
//! already beaten the threshold) — rather than on the model's absolute
//! plateau calibration. Real optimization curves (longer, noisier, less
//! perfectly exponential) sit closer to TimesFM's training distribution; a
//! caller wanting an absolutely-calibrated plateau should fit a small per-family
//! bias correction on held-out runs.
